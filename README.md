# Description

I love Void Linux. It is **simple**, **bloatless** and **cozy**.
Also, I love BSPWM. It is **fast**, **modular** and **cozy**.

# Bootstraping

If you want to use `install.sh` script, then you have to reinstall Void Linux <small>(musl)</small> from zero and run it after reboot from `void-installer`.
Also, you are free to rewrite it to your own kind: I tried to make it as simple as for newbies-welcome.

# Additionals

There is not everything that I wanted to include in this bootstrap.
To be "fully-qualified", you'll need to install:
- `Outline CLI` (VPN tool):
  - https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-sdk/tree/main/x/examples/outline-cli as `outline` under `/usr/local/bin`;
- `gruvbox` theme for `Telegram`, `VK`, `Zulip`, `YouTube`, `GitHub` and `Discord`:
  - https://t.me/addtheme/qoopdata - telegram;
  - https://uso.kkx.one/style/136259 - vk;
  - https://uso.kkx.one/style/168342 - zulip;
  - https://userstyles.world/api/style/7261.user.css - youtube;
  - https://userstyles.world/style/4653/gruvbox-github - github;
  - https://userstyles.world/style/2326/discord-gruvbox - discord;
- `duckduckgo` json settings from `$HOME/.mozilla/firefox/main.main/duckduckgo.json`;
- `Obsidian`:
  - from official website as AppImage and put under `$HOME/.own/obsidian`;
  - replace name of desktop entry from `/home/fidelicura/...` to your user name folder;
