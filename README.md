# Description

I love Void Linux. It is simple, bloatless and cozy. Also, I love BSPWM - it is fast, modular and cozy.

>I prefer `clang` and `musl` over `gcc` and `glibc`

# Bootstraping

If you want to use `install.sh` script, then you have to reinstall Void Linux <small>(musl)</small> from zero and run it after reboot from `void-installer`.
Also, you are free to rewrite it to your own kind: I tried to make it as simple as for newbies-welcome.

# Additionals

There is not everything that I wanted to include in this bootstrap.
To be "fully-qualified", you'll need to install:
- `Zig` (programming language) + `zls` (language server for `Zig`):
  - according folders (under the `$HOME/.zig/`: `src/` for `Zig`, `lsp/` for `zls`);
- `Outline CLI` (VPN tool):
  - https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-sdk/tree/main/x/examples/outline-cli as `output` under `/usr/local/bin`;
