# Description

I love Void Linux. It is **simple**, **bloatless** and **cozy**.
Also, I love BSPWM. It is **fast**, **modular** and **cozy**.

>I prefer `musl` over `glibc` and I don't use any bar.

# Bootstraping

If you want to use `install.sh` script, then you have to reinstall Void Linux <small>(musl)</small> from zero and run it after reboot from `void-installer`.
Also, you are free to rewrite it to your own kind: I tried to make it as simple as for newbies-welcome.

# Additionals

There is not everything that I wanted to include in this bootstrap.
To be "fully-qualified", you'll need to install:
- `Zig` (programming language) + `zls` (language server for `Zig`):
  - according folders (under the `$HOME/.own/`: `zig/src` for `Zig`, `zig/lsp` for `zls`);
- `marksman` (language server for `Markdown`):
  - install https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman/releases and move to `$HOME/.own/marksman/`;
- `Outline CLI` (VPN tool):
  - https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-sdk/tree/main/x/examples/outline-cli as `output` under `/usr/local/bin`;
- `gruvbox` theme for `Telegram`, `Firefox` and `YouTube`:
  - https://t.me/addtheme/qoopdata - telegram;
  - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gruvbox-true-dark/ - firefox;
  - https://userstyles.world/api/style/7261.user.css - youtube;
- `Obsidian` from flathub (so, install `flatpak` and add `flathub` to repositories):
  - install `flatpak` from `xbps`;
  - add flathub to repositories: `sus flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo`;
  - install `obsidian`: `sus flatpak install flathub md.obsidian.Obsidian`;
  - run as root with dbus session without sandboxing: ` sus dbus-run-session flatpak run --devel md.obsidian.Obsidian --no-sandbox`;
